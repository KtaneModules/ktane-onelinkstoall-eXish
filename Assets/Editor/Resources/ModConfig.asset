  description: 'Find a path between two Wikipedia articles using the hyperlinks on
    each article.


    By default this module will attempt to prevent explicit terms from appearing in
    the generated starting and finishing articles, but this is not guaranteed as the
    terms are listed in a spreadsheet. This setting can be disabled in the mod''s
    settings.
